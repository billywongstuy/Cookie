##Aim: C is for Cookie...

###COOKIE:
* small file given by a website to your web browser for storage on 
  your LOCAL machine

* useful for maintaining awareness of identity across multiple web pages
  on same site

* transmitted with request ( sniffable )


C is for Cookie, but that's not good enough for me...

S is for Session (also "Secure")

* sniffable, but encrypted

* in Flask:
  * securely designed cookie
  * session obj works like a dict


eg,

to add data to a session:
   session[key] = value

to remove data from a session:
   session.pop(key)


Q: What must a dev do to guarantee a private session?

A: Generate a private key!

   app.secret_key = <random_generated_string>

to get a randomized string:
   
   import os
   os.urandom(32) --> 32 bits of random data as a string


MAXIM:

NEVER store a private ket in a publicly-viewable location (like GitHub)
